# Welcome to Camper Docs
Camper is a registration and camp management system for Boy Scout councils. It handles complex registrations including individual activity signups and waitlists, payments, options and discounts, and a variety of at-camp features.

From admins creating and managing events down to leaders registering for these events, Camper is designed to be easy to use for everyone involved. Camper is a single point, online registration system that helps reduce lost forms and multiple points of failure. The system offers built in security practices to keep personal information private and features a number of offline and backup redundancies that will keep things running when an internet connection is lost at camp or the unexpected happens.

## Documentation and Getting Help
Getting help with Camper can be done in two different ways. Leaders can find help as a part of a Camper site, simply heading to the help page. The page offers information and a FAQ that describes how to handle some of the more complex parts of camper. Help for leaders can also be attained by the council service center that is using Camper. 

Admin and council staff can find help and more technical documentation in Camper or here at our [Documentation wiki](https://github.com/seanwittmeyer/camper-docs/wiki).

Still lost? Contact Sean or the Camper staff at [Zilifone](http://zilifone.net/connect/). Help for councils using Camper is a simple phone call or email away.
